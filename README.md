markdown-cv
===========

This repository reflects the changes I made over [elipapa's](https://elipapa.github.io/) [markdown-cv](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv) project. Please visit the original repository for instructions regarding web use.

### What's different?

I assume you have seen the output of @elipapa's template. I think he did a very good job in separating the CV content and style, enabling users to edit a plain text file to obtain a pretty decent looking CV. I built on his repository to modify the template for my personal use and for a little bit of a CSS practice.

I moved away from the monospace font choice towards what @kjhealy suggested in his LaTeX template. I also moved the dates to make the overall layout a bit more compact (and easier to manage with my CSS skills :)).

You can see the demo [here!](https://oguzhanogreden.github.io/markdown-cv/)

### What is to be improved?

- I'm not perfectly happy with the asymmetric gaps resulting from e.g. the lack of descenders in "Trinity" and presence of ascenders in "Fellow".
- This is clearly less user friendly than @elipapa's version. I will think about whether I want to improve it and if I do, how.
